  "summary": "The diff implements all 10 requirements comprehensively. All landing page sections (Navbar, Hero, About, How It Works, Statistics, Contact, Footer) are built as React components with the required content, responsive Tailwind CSS styling, anchor-based navigation, static statistics, and references to the generated static assets. No requirements appear to be missing, and the hallucinated features are minor additions that don't conflict with stated non-goals.",

    {
      "description": "Social media links (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, GitHub) added to the Footer",
      "reason": "The build request does not mention social media links in the Footer requirements. REQ-7 only asks for quick nav links, contact information, and brand name.",

      "description": "Functional contact form with state management (name, email, message fields and success confirmation)",
      "reason": "REQ-6 only asks for basic contact details or a simple contact form placeholder. A fully functional form with useState, form submission handler, and success state goes beyond a placeholder.",

      "reason": "REQ-2 only specifies headline, subtitle, and two CTA buttons for the Hero Section. The embedded trust indicators are an addition not specified in the requirements.",
